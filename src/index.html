            <p>
                We at the Maunga Club offer chalets which you could book for your friends or family.
                You can learn more about each chalet by visiting each page, but here is some of the important information:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Only club members can access chalets</li>
                <li>All bookings must be from Friday to Sunday</li>
                <li>Chalets offer shared accommodation for between 6 - 40 people per chalet</li>
            </ul>
            <p>All three chalets are on the mountain, so you can ski to and from the chalets.</p>
